# ADR 0012: Platform-specific settings presentation

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-25)

## Decision

Keep one accessible settings form and command contract, with separate CSS
presentations selected from the desktop WebView's host operating-system user
agent. macOS uses grouped inset rows, colored section icons, subtle sidebar
selection, and compact controls inspired by System Settings. Windows uses Segoe,
outlined cards, and a selection indicator. Linux uses the system font and an
Ubuntu accent. Unknown hosts retain the base presentation.

The Windows presentation follows Windows 11 Settings: a soft background, colored
sidebar icons, a short blue selection marker, larger page headings, individual
outlined setting cards, trailing controls, and 40-by-20 switches. Windows-only
cards include decorative outline icons and secondary descriptions. Caption text
is escaped, and the shared controls retain their labels and keyboard operation.
Windows-only rules live in `ui/src/windows.css`; the form and command handlers remain shared.
The native Windows window starts at 960 by 820 logical pixels and can resize down
to 760 by 460. Below 800 pixels, selectors and sliders move below their labels.
Native title-bar controls remain in place. Light, dark, increased-contrast,
forced-colors, and reduced-motion preferences are handled in the presentation.
The background approximates the reference material with CSS; it is not native Mica.

Windows Night schedule uses its third card for schedule state, next transition,
notification guidance and action errors. The Status label uses the same normal
weight as adjacent fields, with wrapping status text aligned to the right. The
additional default height accommodates multiline status. Move the existing live notice output
into that card on navigation and rerender, then return it to the form on other
pages. This avoids duplicate notices and retains error announcements. Disabled
and outside-period messages remain visible in this Windows status card; macOS
and Linux retain their previous placement and suppression of routine state text.
Across platforms, successful saves, resets, speaker setting changes and test actions
clear prior errors without displaying confirmation messages. Errors retain the
accessible live notice output. Native schedule notifications are independent of
these window messages and keep their selected notification mode.

Platform styling stays in the frontend; domain and synchronization behavior is
unchanged. Color-scheme, increased-contrast, reduced-motion, and keyboard-focus
preferences apply across themes. Icons are decorative; buttons retain text labels.

## Verification

Platform selection has automated coverage for macOS, Windows, Linux, and unknown
hosts. The development-only preview uses mocked Tauri commands and sample devices
for repeatable visual checks without touching speakers or saved configuration.
It is a separate HTML entry point, excluded from the production build.

Check every section at the default and minimum window heights. Verify native
WebView rendering on each OS before release; browser previews do not establish
native platform compatibility.

The macOS window uses a 740-point width and 234-point sidebar, matching the
System Settings reference. Settings use trailing pop-up selectors and compact
white switch and slider thumbs. HTML controls retain native keyboard semantics;
these are WebView controls, not AppKit or SwiftUI controls, so exact system
materials and animations are not guaranteed.

The default macOS height is 760 points so Night schedule, including its status row,
fits without default-size scrolling.
Width remains fixed at 740 points; users can still resize vertically down to 460.

[Toggles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles), and
[Sliders](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sliders).

macOS pop-up controls size to the selected label rather than the longest option
or the trailing column. A hidden, accessibility-excluded label provides intrinsic
width and updates on selection changes; long values remain capped to the row.
Initialize these sizing labels after mounting controls and restoring saved values,
including Night schedule notifications, so rerenders measure the displayed option.

Native window focus controls the macOS accent appearance: the selected sidebar
row and checked switches use the accent while active and neutral gray while
inactive. Focus changes never modify switch values. Subscribe before reading the
initial focus state and ignore a late snapshot after a newer focus event.

The macOS title bar overlays the frontend, retaining native traffic-light window
controls without a separate title strip. A reserved top drag region and content
insets keep the controls unobstructed. Windows and Linux retain standard chrome.

The macOS toolbar includes previous/next section buttons and the current section
title. Navigation follows sidebar order, does not wrap at the ends, and uses the
same page activation path as the sidebar, including diagnostic refreshes.


## Ubuntu presentation (2026-09-26)

Linux uses `ui/src/linux.css` on both x86-64 and ARM64. The native window starts
at 1080 by 800 logical pixels. Width is fixed at 1080; vertical resizing remains
available down to 460. The default height fits Night schedule and its save notice
without scrolling.
A 270-pixel sidebar, neutral selection, symbolic icons, centered content, white
rounded groups with separated rows, trailing selectors, 48-by-26 switches and
white slider thumbs follow the Ubuntu Settings reference. At compact widths,
controls move below their labels. Ubuntu Sans and system sans-serif fallbacks
keep text consistent. Dark mode, focus, reduced motion and contrast remain supported.

These are accessible HTML controls in the existing WebView, not GTK4 widgets.
Native window chrome and select popups remain managed by the platform. The
frontend mirrors Yaru/GNOME presentation without replacing the shared command
contract or adopting a second native UI implementation. Slider fill is derived
from the current input value during render, refresh and user input; it does not
write configuration. Schedule cells explicitly retain square corners rather than
inheriting the rounded action-button shape.

and [GNOME switches](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/patterns/controls/switches.html).

Browser tests navigate the production form, select and save schedule blocks,
check square cells before and after rerenders, and exercise switches and sliders
at default/minimum heights in both color schemes. The square-cell regression failed
with the previous generic Linux button radius and passes with the scoped styling.
Native Ubuntu WebKit and desktop integration still require the verification matrix.

The Ubuntu Volume test action keeps a 16-pixel inset and normal button sizing
instead of inheriting full settings-row padding. Browser regressions verify the
inset, keyboard activation, and that the default Night schedule view fits after
Save; both layout defects were reproduced with the previous presentation.

Ubuntu tray icons use the white glyph for both application color schemes: the
default Ubuntu top bar stays dark independently of the Settings window theme.
The disconnected red badge remains intact. Registration, theme notifications and
connection refreshes share this image selection. Other platforms retain their
existing theme-based selection. Custom Linux panels with light backgrounds are
not covered by this Ubuntu-specific contrast policy.

## Wayland title-bar input

Require Tauri 2.12 and its Tao 0.37 dependency, incorporating the upstream
[Wayland decoration repair](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/pull/1218).
The previous Tao title-bar event overlay swallowed native button clicks after
showing a hidden window; double-clicking or resizing could make them work again.
Use GTK's repaired native decoration path rather than synthesizing a resize.
The shell's shared close handler still hides Settings and prevents destruction,
keeping synchronization running. A mock runtime test exercises first show,
immediate close, reopen, and another immediate close with no resize events.
The dependency regression guard rejects the affected Tao version. Neither test
can validate compositor hit testing; the native reproduction remains required.
