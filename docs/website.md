# Public website

The user-facing website lives in `pages/`. It uses static HTML and CSS with local
assets, no build dependencies, and no third-party fonts. Optional tracking is
managed through a consent-gated Google Tag Manager integration. The desktop
application and its build remain separate.

## Preview

Run `python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory pages` from the repository root and
open `http://localhost:8080`. Check both the landing page and privacy page at
mobile and desktop widths. Relative asset and navigation URLs support both a
GitHub project subpath and a custom domain.

## Publish

In repository Settings > Pages, select **GitHub Actions** as the source. The
Website workflow publishes only `pages/` when changes to that directory or the
workflow reach `main`. It does not depend on release creation or application
packaging. Manual dispatch is supported on `main` only. Configure the
`github-pages` environment to allow deployments from `main`.

Changes follow the normal feature branch, approved PR, and Gitflow process.
No deployment runs from feature branches or `develop`.

The machine-readable update catalog is published with the same atomic `pages/`
artifact at `updates/v1/catalog.json`. Validate it with
`python3 scripts/validate-update-catalog.py`. Its entries represent independently
verified public availability per distribution and application architecture; a
build, tag, upload, submission or workspace version is not sufficient evidence.
See [ADR 0019](decisions/0019-distribution-aware-updates.md) for the v1 contract.

## Content maintenance

Keep feature descriptions aligned with README.md and the user wiki. The website
privacy page reproduces PRIVACY.md and adds a separate website hosting notice.
When the application policy changes, update both copies together, preserving
its effective date. The policy currently names Windows and macOS audio outputs;
review the source policy for Ubuntu coverage before changing the legal text.
Keep `pages/license.txt` identical to LICENSE. Do not add analytics, remote fonts,
or third-party embeds without reviewing the website privacy notice.

## Permanent installer links

Download buttons use GitHub's `releases/latest/download/` URLs. Release CI publishes
one fixed-name file per package: macOS DMG, Windows
x64/ARM64 installers, and Ubuntu x64/ARM64 DEBs. Versioned build filenames
are renamed before upload; the release tag supplies the version. `scripts/prepare-release-downloads.sh` validates all
release assets before renaming them. Windows and Linux filenames explicitly identify x64 and ARM64. The old architecture-free
Windows URL and macOS ZIP are not published in future releases. Prereleases also receive these assets,
but the latest stable URLs do not select prereleases.

The website does not need to be rebuilt when a release is published. Before
first deploying these links, publish a stable release with the updated workflow
or upload the matching fixed-name assets to the existing latest stable release.
Older releases do not gain these files automatically.

## Search and assistant discovery

The canonical origin is `https://svb.miguel.ms`. All three HTML pages declare canonical,
Open Graph, social-card, and JSON-LD metadata. The sitemap lists only canonical
HTML pages. robots.txt allows crawling and links to the sitemap. llms.txt is a
curated project guide, an emerging convention rather than a ranking guarantee.
Keep its claims consistent with the visible page and privacy policy. No ratings,
reviews, or unverified compatibility claims are added to structured data.

The application schema retains the former product name as `alternateName` for
the rebrand. Social images include their actual dimensions and accessible text.
Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_website_seo.py` to
check metadata consistency, sitemap coverage, image dimensions, and local links
and fragments. The website validation workflow runs these checks before merge.

After deployment, submit the sitemap in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster
Tools. Validate structured data with their inspection tools. Updating these files
does not itself submit the site or guarantee indexing or rich results.

## Markdown versions

Every HTML page has a generated Markdown counterpart (`index.md`, `privacy.md`, `upgrade.md`).
The HTML alternate link and llms.txt point to these files. Run
`python3 scripts/generate-page-markdown.py` after editing page content, and
`python3 scripts/generate-page-markdown.py --check` to detect stale copies.
The conversion includes main content and footer notices, preserves absolute
links, and omits navigation and decorative graphics. The sitemap continues to
list the canonical HTML pages only.

## Website consent and Google Tag Manager

The head loads local consent.js with defer. It queues denied Consent Mode defaults
before loading container GTM-P7RPRQBZ only after an optional category is granted.
There is intentionally no unconditional GTM script or noscript iframe: either
would contact Google before consent. JavaScript-disabled visits remain untracked.

Advanced choices map to analytics_storage, ad_storage/ad_user_data, and separately
ad_personalization. Personalized advertising requires advertising consent. Choice
storage expires after 180 days; invalid records fail closed. Withdrawal reloads
and attempts cleanup of accessible Google first-party cookies. Cross-tab changes
and back/forward cache restoration reload to honor the latest saved preference.

### Container configuration required before publishing tags

The website cannot sandbox tags inside GTM. In the container, configure additional
consent checks on every analytics, advertising, custom HTML, and third-party tag.
Analytics tags require analytics_storage. Advertising tags require ad_storage and
ad_user_data; personalized advertising additionally requires ad_personalization.
Use svb_consent_update triggers with the corresponding svb_analytics,
svb_advertising, or svb_personalization boolean data-layer variables. Include an
appropriate permitted page-load trigger for returning visitors. Never trigger
optional tags unconditionally on All Pages or Consent Initialization. Built-in
Google consent checks alone may permit cookieless pings when a category is denied.

Verify each consent combination in GTM Preview/Tag Assistant before publishing the
container. Container access and its configured tags are outside this repository;
website tests cover the loader and signals, not tag-level enforcement. Keep the
privacy notice and cookie retention details aligned with the actual published tags.

Run `node --test scripts/tests/consent.test.cjs` and regenerate Markdown after HTML
changes. The preference is website-only; the desktop app has no new telemetry.

Night schedule appears alongside the other capabilities in the same feature-card
grid, with matching illustrations, typography, and spacing. Five cards use two
columns on desktop (two, two, then one), leaving space for a future feature. Feature copy describes the released
product because the site publishes with the release. Keep the visible copy and
llms.txt aligned. The section introduces no tracking or external assets.

The Ubuntu card provides distinct x64 and ARM64 download buttons. The ARM64
URL targets the next release that includes `speaker-volume-bridge-linux-arm64.deb`;
it will become available after the first GA release containing that asset.

The Windows card likewise provides x64 and ARM64 buttons. Publish both
Windows installer assets in a stable release before deploying
the updated website. Generated Markdown and llms.txt carry the same choices.
