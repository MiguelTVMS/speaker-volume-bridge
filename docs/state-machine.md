# Synchronization state machine

`Connecting` waits for a Sonos read. With two-way synchronization enabled,
its first confirmed state is applied to the local system. With two-way
synchronization disabled, Sonos observations update connection state without
changing local audio, and the initial local state is sent to Sonos.
`Synchronized` has a current Sonos-confirmed state.
`WaitingForSonosConfirmation` retains only the newest local desired volume.
`SubscriptionDegraded` and `PollingFallback` represent unavailable or stale
event delivery. `SonosUnavailable`, `LocalAudioUnavailable`, and
`UnsupportedLocalDevice` are recoverable runtime states. A restored connection
returns to `Connecting` and reconciles from Sonos.

An application-originated local callback is suppressed. Windows identifies it
through a stable Core Audio event-context GUID; macOS compares it with a
short-lived expected write using an adapter-configured tolerance; Ubuntu uses
the PulseAudio-compatible `pactl` event stream with short-lived expected-write
tracking. A Sonos
confirmation always clears pending intents. It wins over any requested value
only when two-way synchronization is enabled.

Volume changes are debounced and coalesced; mute changes bypass the debounce.
The coordinator does not resend a volume or mute value until it differs from
the last sent value. When GENA delivery is healthy it polls slowly for health;
on subscription loss it polls once per second until event delivery recovers.

Night Mode scheduling is an independent optional controller. Disabled or unselected
means no recurring effects. Explicit Save remains a one-shot apply operation even
while recurring scheduling is disabled. Unsupported/unavailable means paused with configuration retained.
Reconciliation establishes the expected current value without a notification.
Scheduled entry enforces on; scheduled exit applies off once and permits subsequent
manual changes. Transient failures retry with bounded backoff; confirmed normal
boundaries produce notification intent. Applying a saved schedule produces
notification intent only when the edit changes whether the current time is inside
the enabled schedule, after confirming the resulting speaker state. Saves that
remain inside/outside and saves with recurrence disabled stay silent. On start/On end/On start and end/Never filters
that intent without changing controller state. Selection or schedule changes discard old
pending intent. Notification preferences never reset this controller. See ADR 0013.

The optional night schedule Loudness policy runs beside the Night Mode controller.
Active plus opted-in enforces Loudness off. The bridge persists speaker-scoped
ownership before changing an on value, retains it across restart, and restores on
exit or policy disablement. An already-off value creates no restoration ownership.
Unavailable or unsupported Loudness retries independently without changing the
Night Mode state or notification intent. A restoration marker for one speaker is
never applied to a different selected speaker.

Enabling a previously disabled schedule during a selected period applies Night Mode
immediately and sends a start notification after speaker confirmation when On start or
On start and end is selected. Enabling outside selected periods, enabling an already
enabled schedule, and disabling scheduling do not notify. Disabling leaves the speaker
state unchanged. The worker subsequently reconciles silently to avoid duplicate
notifications.

Opt-in UI demo builds run this state machine and the normal Night Mode scheduler
against a loopback simulated Sonos speaker. Local audio remains native. See ADR 0014.

Audio echo suppression retains repeated and overlapping expected local states for
500 ms without pausing listening. Unchanged local properties are not rewritten.
See [ADR 0017](decisions/0017-volume-feedback-suppression.md) for platform behavior,
regression coverage, and the limitations of value-based origin detection.

## Update checks

The update state is independent of synchronization: idle, checking, up_to_date,
update_available, unavailable or unsupported. Only complete public release
metadata with a compatible official asset can produce an offer. Stable only
excludes prereleases; Include prereleases includes GA and previews. Version
precedence rejects equal/older versions. Missing candidates and failed API requests
remain unavailable. A policy change clears old actions and increments generation;
only matching responses can commit or notify. Source migration invalidates former
catalog offers/freshness. Shutdown cancels the worker and pending requests;
duplicate starts do not create another checker. See ADR 0021.

## Upgrading from the former app

Users quit and remove the former app before using the renamed app. The shell
starts synchronization directly and does not inspect other processes, gate writes
on a legacy-app check, or display a conflict warning. Settings and Night Mode keep
their normal selection/write serialization and explicit stop behavior. See
[decision 0018](decisions/0018-rebrand-and-legacy-protection.md) and the
[manual removal guide](removing-old-app.md).
