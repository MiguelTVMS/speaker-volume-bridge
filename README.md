# Speaker Volume Bridge

> [!WARNING]
> **Upgrading from Sonos Volume Bridge? Quit and remove the old app first.**
> Running both apps can cause conflicting volume and Night Mode changes. Follow
> the [complete old-app removal guide](docs/removing-old-app.md), including login
> items and optional settings cleanup, before using Speaker Volume Bridge.

Formerly **Sonos Volume Bridge**. The same app with a new name. See the
[upgrade guide](docs/rebrand-upgrade.md) to preserve your existing settings.

Control the volume of a Sonos speaker with the volume controls you already use
on your computer.

Speaker Volume Bridge is a small background app for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. It keeps a
Sonos speaker and your chosen computer audio output in step—without requiring a
cloud account, Home Assistant, or a separate remote control.

## Why use it?

If you use a Sonos speaker while working at your computer, changing the volume
usually means reaching for the Sonos app or the speaker itself. Speaker Volume
Bridge connects that speaker to your computer's normal volume controls, so
keyboard volume keys, system controls, and supported audio-device controls can
adjust it for you.

The app lives quietly in the menu bar on macOS or the system tray on Windows and Ubuntu.
Open it when you want to change a setting; otherwise, it stays out of the way.

## What it can do

- **Keep volume in sync.** Change the volume on your computer and the selected
  Sonos speaker follows.
- **Synchronize in both directions.** Optionally, changes made on the Sonos
  speaker can update your computer volume too.
- **Follow your current audio output.** Let the app follow the system output as
  you switch devices, or keep it attached to one specific output.
- **Synchronize mute.** Choose whether muting one side should mute the other.
- **Set a safe maximum.** Limit how loud the Sonos speaker is allowed to become,
  even when the computer volume is turned all the way up.
- **Choose how volume changes feel.** Use a direct match, a gentler curve with
  more control at low volumes, or scale the full computer range to your chosen
  maximum.
- **Schedule Night Mode.** Use one weekly schedule for the selected compatible
  speaker, with half-hour blocks and optional start/end notifications.
- **Start automatically.** Run the bridge when you sign in so it is ready when
  you need it.
- **Recover from interruptions.** The app reconnects when a speaker, audio
  output, or network connection becomes available again.
- **Show clear status information.** See the selected speaker, current volumes,
  connection state, and helpful diagnostics from the settings window.

## What you need

- A Windows computer, a Mac running macOS 13 or later, or Ubuntu with
  PulseAudio or PipeWire and `pactl` (`pulseaudio-utils`)
- A Sonos speaker on the same local network as the computer
- A computer audio output whose volume can be changed by software

Speaker Volume Bridge controls volume, optional mute, and supported speaker settings
such as Night Mode. It does not
play, stream, capture, redirect, or modify your audio, and it is not intended to
replace the Sonos app as a full speaker controller.

## Getting started

1. Download the package for your computer from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/MiguelTVMS/speaker-volume-bridge/releases/latest).
2. Install and open Speaker Volume Bridge.
3. Choose the Sonos speaker you want to control.
4. Choose whether to follow the computer's current audio output or a specific
   output.
5. Adjust mute synchronization, two-way synchronization, volume feel, and the
   maximum speaker volume to suit you.

Most settings are saved automatically. Night schedule grid edits use **Save schedule**;
saving also applies the current block immediately, even with recurring scheduling
disabled. See the [Night schedule guide](docs/how-it-works.md#night-mode-schedule). After setup, you can close the settings
window and leave the app running from the menu bar or system tray.

> [!WARNING]
> The direct-download and Mac App Store editions of Speaker Volume Bridge are

## Privacy

Speaker Volume Bridge works directly between your computer and Sonos speaker on
your local network. It does not require an online account or send your volume
activity to a cloud service. Internet access is not needed for everyday volume
synchronization. Recognized releases can check the public project catalog for an
edition-compatible update; this can be disabled in Settings and sends no speaker
or configuration data. See the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for complete details.

## Project status

Speaker Volume Bridge is an early community project. Development is currently
limited to hands-on testing with a Sonos Ray, so support for other Sonos models
may need validation. Windows and macOS packages are available, but hardware
combinations vary. Ubuntu support requires the PulseAudio-compatible audio
service supplied by PulseAudio or PipeWire. Please create a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/MiguelTVMS/speaker-volume-bridge/issues) to
report compatibility problems or help develop support for other Sonos speakers.
